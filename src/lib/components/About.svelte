	<p>
		I'm a full stack developer with a background in consulting, systems administration, and support.
		My work is focused in user friendliness and future proofing, utilizing up and coming frameworks
		and technologies. Having spent most of my career in user facing roles, I strive to build my
		projects (and code) in a user friendly, easily utilized way. I've built projects using React,
		Vue, Node.js, and Express, to name a few. I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to a
		collaborative team, building innovative solutions that prioritize usability and functionality.
